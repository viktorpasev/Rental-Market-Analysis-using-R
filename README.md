# Rental-Market-Analysis-using-R
Introduction
	Between the economic impact of the pandemic and slowing wage increases, many Americans, particularly younger adults, have criticised rising rent prices and difficulties with being able to find a home. In states with larger cities in particular (New York, California, Florida, etc), renters have noted a sharp increase in rent prices, prompting many to relocate to more rural and suburban areas/states. However, as a result of this exodus to less populated states, these once attractive, developing locations also raised their rental prices to match increased demand. Simultaneously, prices in states with large cities remain at their peaks, as demand for those locations remains steady. 
	As rent prices across the country continue to increase, this project will aim to explore and compare the disparity in rent prices and square footage between larger, urban areas and smaller, rural locations. Through an analysis of this data, renters can make financially sound decisions and identify trends in rental prices. 

Data and Methods
	The data set utilized for this project was taken from UC Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository and features 10,000 rows of rental property information, including a count of bedrooms and bathrooms, monthly rental prices, square footage, and the state in which they are located. The data set was published in 2019, with the information being obtained from rental listing website RentLingo. 
	In order to compare states and their average rental prices and square footage, dot plots have been produced that compares the two. Regression models between two states were also created in order to compare the impact on rental price with an increase of 1 square foot of space. These visualizations and models will provide an easily digestible comparison between rental prices and square footage, providing valuable insights for renters and decision making. 
Results 
	For an initial comparison between average rental prices and square footage, we can visualize each state as a dot on a dot plot with average square footage on the x axis and average monthly rent on the y axis. After plotting and labeling each dot with the state it represents, some expected trends begin to emerge, along with some surprising insights. See Figure 1.

Figure 1: Average Rent Prices vs. Average Square Footage by State
	As expected, states such as California exhibit some of the highest rent prices in the country, likely due to the many large, populous cities in the state. Additionally, and perhaps surprisingly, Hawaii has the highest average rent price in the country; however, considering the state’s excellent weather, proximity to coastal areas, and lack of viable land to build additional real estate, this high rental price is understandable. 
	While this dot plot displays a general distribution of rent prices compared to square footage per state, it is not very useful in conducting analysis or making an inference from the data. For example, a primarily rural state such as Montana has an average monthly rent that is approximately the same as a state like Florida, which is a more favorable location and is closer in proximity to large cities. However, crucially, for this similar average rent cost between Montana and Florida, Montana offers nearly 600 additional square feet of living space. In order to make this data more useful, we will conduct a regression analysis on a few selected states of interest to compare the average cost per additional square foot of space in order to determine which state presents the highest return on investment per dollar spent. 
	The states chosen to conduct this analysis/comparison differ between their population, size/frequency of large cities, and available land area. Montana was chosen to represent less populous, rural states, while Washington D.C. was chosen because of its large population relative to its land area, as well as the significance of its location. In order to conduct a regression analysis comparing price and square footage of apartments in each of these states, the data was filtered by state name, rental price, and square footage using the dplyr package. Then, each of these newly constructed data sets were passed into the lm() function, as well as the two variables of interest (price and square footage). Upon summarizing the model, a linear equation can be derived from the results and then graphically represented using the ggplot2 package. See Figure 2. 
 
Montana Price = $649.07 + $0.71sqft

Washington DC Price = $936.91 + $1.78sqft
Figure 2: Graphs of linear regression models comparing square footage and price of apartments in Montana and Washington DC. 
	Before we can analyze these graphs and equations, it is important to note that the y-intercept in this case is not of much use, as an apartment with a size of 0 square feet is not possible. Additionally, the range of apartment sizes differ between each state, so an accurate, direct comparison can be difficult to achieve. Despite these issues in the data however, the regression models are still useful tools to determine the approximate increase in monthly rental price per additional square foot of space in each state. In Montana, an additional square foot of apartment space will increase your monthly rent by approximately $0.71, with a p-value of 0.03, indicating that this coefficient is statistically significant. In Washington DC, an additional square foot of apartment space will increase your monthly rent by approximately $1.78, with a p-value of 2e-16, indicating that this coefficient is also statistically significant. When comparing these coefficients directly, one can see the substantial increase in rent prices per square footage between large urban centers like DC and sparsely populated rural states like Montana. In Washington DC, an increase in one square foot of apartment space will increase rent by 1 dollar more than the same increase in space in Montana. Similar trends also exist between other states, such as California and Alabama, where an increase in 1 square foot of spaces costs an additional $1.88 in California, while the same increase costs an additional $0.58 in Alabama. This implies that property space is much more highly valued and expensive in “larger” states than smaller ones. This conclusion is logical, as states with larger populations and major cities present more opportunity, attracting larger populations, and creating a larger demand for living space. As a result, to meet the large demand, real estate in these “larger” states is smaller in size and more expensive. 

Conclusion
	The initial dot plots and regression models appear to indicate that states with larger populations, a high density of large cities, and less usable land area are typically more expensive places to rent an apartment than states which are more rural, sparsely populated, and contain little to no large cities. This approach in analyzing entire states is likely not the most accurate representation of rental prices throughout the state, as differences exist between cities and neighborhoods. For example, an apartment in Manhattan, New York City, New York, is likely much more expensive than a similarly sized apartment in upstate Albany. Additionally, this analysis does not consider other important factors in rental costs, such as amenities, location, the number of bedrooms/bathrooms, etc. However, the models and visualizations built from this data set are useful tools in analyzing the general state of the rental market in each state, aiding potential buyers in weighing the pros and cons of renting in an inflated market. The trends within this data could also be useful in determining cheaper markets for buyers who are moving from expensive areas or investors seeking to make a large return on their investment. In the future, this data set could be used to determine trends within specific cities over a period of time in order to better understand exactly why these disparities in rental prices exist.
